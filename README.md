# Exploring the differences in Clusteringpatternsbetween ND2 and Cyt-b genes using the Drosophilidae Family as a Case Study
Mitochondrial genes are often used for phylogenic studies due to the relative ease of sequencing when compared with other genes.
Another reason they are used is rapid evolution rate which can be used to find differences in closely related Taxa due to their sequence variability.(Finneganetal.,2025).
They are also passed down through maternal inheritance which means they generally do not undergo recombination and can make lineage tracing easier.(Manishaetal.,2023)
NADH Dehydrogenase Subunit2(ND2) and Cytochrome b (Cyt-b) are two commonly used mitochondrial genes.
The key differences between the two of them are:
Difference in sequence length:While both sequence lengths are comparable, ND2 is generally longer than Cyt-B and this is also reflected in this study.
Difference in sequence variability:Cyt-B is generally more conserved than ND2 and has more identical nucleotides.(Campilloetal.,2019)
Due to this reason,we can compare the ability of these genes to function as classifiers of sequences and as a result classifiers of taxonomic groups.
# Hypotheses and Research Question
Due to the reasons listed above we can then generate these interesting contrasting hypotheses.
Highly variable genes act as great classifiers as their divergence shows evolutionary signals than can be used to spot differences between taxa.
Better conserved genes with reduced variability act as better classifiers as they would keep ancestral relationships.
These hypotheses can the help us to generate the following research question:
**Do fast-evolving mitochondrial genes and slow-evolving mitochondrial genes differ in their ability to resolve taxonomic
relationships?**

# Discussion
Our results show that fast evolving and slow evolving genes do behave differently in a number of ways.
Firstly,we are shown that at the taxonomic level used for this research(Drosophilidae Family),Cyt-b the slower evolving gene acts as a better classifier probably due to its ability to remain conserved with small changes over longer periods of time thus maintaining its ability to show the ancestral relationship.
This is supported by existing literature as a study done on mammals in 2010 shows Cyt-B having high classification ability at the Superorder,order and family taxonomic levels.(Tobeetal.,2010)
Secondly,thehighly varying branch length of ND2 suggests that while it might not be a very accurate classifier at higher levels it could prove useful at lower levels like species and subspecies levels.
This is again corroborated by a recent study that showed that combining  Cyt-b and ND2 genes act as a stronger classifier than any singular mitochondrial gene. (Finneganetal.,2025)

Our final hypothesis can then be modified to state that:
**The classification ability of a mitochondrial gene is determined by both the nucleotide variability (fast vs slow evolving) and the taxonomic level being classified.**
